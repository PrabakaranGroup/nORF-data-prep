This repository contains the supporting code for our manuscript "A platform for curated products from novel Open Reading Frames (nORFs) prompts reinterpretation of disease variants." There are two RMarkdown documents for reproducing our results:

## 1. nORF_Data_Prep.Rmd
This is a complete walkthrough for processing [OpenProt](http://www.openprot.org/) ([Brunet et al., 2018](https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gky936)) and [sorfs.org](http://www.sorfs.org/) ([Olexiouk et al., 2018](https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkx1130)) into a human novel open reading frame (nORF) dataset. This code can be run to reproduce the nORFs datasets available at nORFs.org and used as input for the manuscript analyses.

## 2. nORF_Data_Prep.Rmd
This code can be used to generate all tables/figures (excluding diagrams) in the manuscript and details all R code used in analyses.
